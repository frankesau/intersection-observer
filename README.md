# intersection-observer
Use intersection observer API to load more content as the user scrolls.

This web app was built using the following technologies and services:

* [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
* [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

The intention of this project is to test the intersection observer API for lazy loading more content.
